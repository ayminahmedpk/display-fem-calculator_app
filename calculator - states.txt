Input types:

	Number  [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
	Decimal [.]
	Operand [x, /, +, -]
	Equals  [=]
	Delete  [DEL] 
	C key   [RESET]


Major states:

    - First  number expected
    - Second number expected
    - Calculation completed (implemented as first number with cache argument)
    - Math error


Input behavior in states:

    (Assume input and decimal control is in place already)

    - First number expected:

    (Starts with setting display as cache. Cache is whatever was passed to it
     on creation, or 0 by default)

        * Number: Stores a number in a temporary cache in itself (which can be
                  appended to), while telling context object to overwrite the
                  display field with it. (If this is a first time that a number
                  has been pressed on this object, the current cache is
                  overrwitten - as is display).

        * Decimal: As expected.

        * Operand: Transitions context object to 'Second number expected' state,
                   while passing the 'first number' and 'operand' values to the
                   new state object.

        * Equals: Replaces itself with a new First Number Expected state object
                  with the current cache as the constructor argument

        * Delete: Performs deletion operation on cache, and deals with the
                  context's provided display handler as appropriate.

        * C key : Goes to a new First number expected state with a clean cache


    - Second number expected:

    (Expects to receive 'First Number' and 'Operand' values as constructor)
        
    (Starts with displaying first number which it will also maintain in cache)

        * Number: Also stores this second number in another temporary cache
                  within itself, similar to how 'First number expected' state
                  did with its main input cache - displaying it

        * Decimal: Same as previous state

        * Operand: Performs the calculation, transitions to a new Second Number
                   Expected state, while passing it the answer as first number
                   as well as the operand

        * Equals: Transitions to a new First number expected state, while
                  passing it the answer as cache

        * Delete: Performs deletion operation on the cache

        * C key : Goes to a new First number expected state with a clean cache


    - Math error:

        Nothing happens unless C key is pressed. All other inputs are ignored.
        And when C is pressed, it transitions state to a First Number Expected
        state with a clean cache.





questions:

- What about user pressing '=' in the first number expected mode? Will pressing
  another number not start over with clean input (as it should)
