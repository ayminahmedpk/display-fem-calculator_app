when screen is empty (reads 0),

an operand button means an operation on 0
. button means 0.
del button does nothing
reset button does nothing

hmm. These buttons seem to have different effects and flags that they trigger,
based on the current state of the calculator.

The state of the calculator can be:

* First input state (default state when started)
* Second input state
